Welcome to my Zombie Survival FPS Game project, where you must survive waves of relentless zombies using limited resources and strategic gameplay.

## Key Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Survival Against Waves:** Face increasing waves of zombies, challenging your survival skills.
- **Resource Management:** Manage limited ammunition and health strategically to survive longer.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Enjoy fast-paced FPS action with responsive shooting mechanics and challenging enemy AI.

### Design Patterns and Programming Principles
- **State Pattern:** Implemented for zombie behavior management, ensuring dynamic and varied enemy actions.
- **MVC Pattern:** Utilized for player management, separating logic, UI, and player input for cleaner code structure.
- **Object Pooling:** Employed for spawning zombies efficiently, enhancing performance during intense gameplay.
- **Singleton Design Pattern:** Used for centralized service access, promoting modular and efficient code architecture.
- **Service Locator Design Principle:** Implemented for managing and accessing game services, reducing dependency on singletons.

### Programming Skills Showcase
- **Sound FX:** Custom sound effects integrated for immersive gameplay, enhancing player experience.
- **Gun Animations:** Created animations for idle, shooting, and reloading actions, improving weapon realism.
- **Zombie Animations:** Implemented varied animations for zombies, enhancing visual feedback and gameplay immersion.

- **Loading Screen with Asynchronous Level Loading:** Developed a loading screen that asynchronously loads game levels, with a progress bar indicating loading status.
- **Highest Wave Survived Tracker:** Implemented a mechanism to track and display the highest wave survived, encouraging replayability and competition among players.

### Game Development Principles
- **SOLID Principles:** Applied principles such as Open/Closed, Single Responsibility, and Dependency Inversion to ensure scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **DRY Principle:** Avoided code duplication by reusing components and implementing efficient algorithms.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Followed best practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and extensibility of codebase.

## Project Details
- **Unity Version:** 2022.3.12
